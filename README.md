Time2Leave is an iOS App that allows people to create reminders to leave so that they arrive at a specific location at the time they planned to arrive.

## Installation

To build Time2Leave you need to create a file called **ApiKeys.plist** in the app folder that needs to contain an entry called **GOOGLE_API_KEY** that contains your Google API Key.

## Usage

To create a reminder a user has to navigate through four different views:

1. *Where do you want to go?*
  * Select your destination using the autocomplete field
  * You can save favorite locations to easily reuse them
2. *How do you want to get there?*
  * Select your means of transportation and the time you want to leave or arrive
3. *Which Route do you want to take?*
  * If there is more than one possible route select the one you prefer
4. *When do you want to leave?*
  * If the departure time of your selected route is far enough in the future set up a reminder for a specific time
  * You can open Google Maps from this view to display directions from your location to your selected destination
